osTicket has been installed, but still needs to be configuration to enable it function as a ticketing system. One thing to note is that I switch between Admin and Agent panels as each panel has different configurations. To tell which panel is used, look at the top right of the osTicket screen. If it reads Agent Panel, the Admin panel is the one being used and vice versa.
